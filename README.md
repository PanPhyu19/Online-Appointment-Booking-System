# Instructions to Run the Project
This website is developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it requires a local server to run on your device. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

Download and install XAMPP (or similar software that includes Apache and MySQL).

Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.

2. Set Up the Project Files.
   
Place the program files in the htdocs directory of XAMPP.

Typically, this folder is located at C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows.

Ensure the file structure and folder names match the references in the code.

3. Open phpMyAdmin by typing: http://localhost/phpmyadmin

In phpMyAdmin, create a new database:

Click on New in the left sidebar.

Enter the name of the database as computingproject and click Create.

Import the provided database file:

Click on the newly created computingproject database in the left sidebar.

Go to the Import tab.

Click Choose File, navigate to the program file directory, and select computingproject.sql.

Click Go to import the database.

Update the database credentials in the PHP files as needed (e.g., host, username, password, and database_name).

4. Run the Website.
   
Open your browser and type the following: http://localhost/filename

Replace filename with the name of the folder and the main file. (e.g. http://localhost/PROGRAM/index.php)
